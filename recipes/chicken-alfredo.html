    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A homestyle classic combing chicken, a homemade alfredo sauce, and pasta to create a delicious combonation of flavors.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound fettuccine</li>
        <li> 1 sprig chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low; simmer for 5 minutes. Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the cover on for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut into bite-size slices.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup.</li>
        <li>Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth; bring to a simmer and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly incorporated; repeat until about 1/2 cup of the warm cream mixture is used.</li>
        <li>Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture almost comes to a simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until nearly cooked through, about 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes until thick.</li>
        <li>Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to serve.</li>
    </ol>
