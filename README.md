# odin-recipes
Creating a simple recipe website, following the instructions from The Odin Project. In this project, I will be using the basic skills I have learned, such as utilising the Command Line Interface, using Git, and basic HTML syntax.

The project is very basic, but I ended up learning a lot of HTML basics, but mostly gained a better knowledge of using Git and using the CLI.
